# Atlas Framework

Atlas Framework is a modular set of lightweight, dependency-free Luau primitives for Roblox. It provides core building blocks like Promise (async flow), Signal (event dispatch), and ResourceManager (deterministic cleanup) to keep gameplay and systems code simple, predictable, and safe across both client and server.
